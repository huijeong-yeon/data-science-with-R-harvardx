# Week 3 – Statistics and R (HarvardX PH525.1x)

This folder contains R scripts from Week 3 of the HarvardX course *Statistics and R*, focused on hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, permutation tests, and power simulations using the `babies.txt` dataset.

## Topics Covered

- Confidence intervals using:
  - Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
  - t-distribution approximation
- Type I and Type II error interpretation
- Power analysis via simulation (sample sizes: 5, 30, 60, 90, 120)
- Permutation tests for:
  - Difference in means
  - Difference in medians

## Files

- `week3_babies.R`: All simulation code for CLT, t-tests, permutation-based inference, and power estimation using the `babies.txt` dataset.

## Packages Used

- Base R
- `dplyr`
- `rafalib`
- `downloader`
