# 📘 Statistics and R – HarvardX PH525.1x

This repository contains R scripts and notes from the HarvardX course *Statistics and R (PH525.1x)*, taught by Professor Rafael Irizarry. It includes exercises, simulations, and visualizations from Weeks 1 through 4, covering key topics in statistical thinking and data analysis using R.

## 📅 Weekly Topics

### ✅ Week 1 – Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis
- Exploring built-in datasets (`cars`, `heights`, `InsectSprays`, `msleep`, `olive`)
- Summary statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- Visualization: histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
- Data types, coercion, subsetting
- Distributional shape and skewness

### ✅ Week 2 – Random Variables, Probability Distributions, and the Central Limit Theorem
- Random sampling, sample means, and standard errors
- Population vs sample distributions
- Null distribution and hypothesis testing framework
- CLT simulations and approximation
- Power and Type II error estimation

### ✅ Week 3 – Inference
- Confidence intervals using CLT and t-distributions
- Permutation tests for means and medians
- Power simulations across varying sample sizes
- Exact vs approximate p-values
- Application to `babies.txt` dataset

### ✅ Week 4 – Exploratory Data Analysis and Robust Summaries
- Correlation and group comparison using `nym.2002` (NYC Marathon data)
- Data reshaping and exploratory analysis using `ChickWeight`
- Sensitivity of mean, median, sd, and mad to outliers
- t-tests vs Wilcoxon tests
- Visualizing shifts in test statistics

## 📁 Folder Structure

## 📎 Notes

All scripts are written to be reproducible and annotated with English comments.  
No tidyverse dependencies unless explicitly noted.  
This repository reflects a base-R focused learning path through the PH525.1x curriculum.
