# 📘 Week 1 – Statistics and R (HarvardX PH525.1x)

This folder contains practice scripts from Week 1 of the HarvardX course *Statistics and R*, taught by Prof. Rafael Irizarry.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Inspecting base R datasets (e.g., `cars`)
- Using `class()`, `nrow()`, `colnames()` for dataset exploration
- Subsetting data with `[ , ]` and `$`
- Filtering data with `filter()`
- Selecting columns with `select()`
- Calculating means with `mean()`, `unlist()`, and `summarize()`
- Using `%>%` (pipe operator) to chain operations
- Filtering and summarizing by condition (e.g., primates’ sleep data)
- Random sampling with `sample()` and `set.seed()`
