# Data Science: Probability â€“ HarvardX (PH125.3x)

This folder contains exercises and visualizations from the HarvardX course *Data Science: Probability* (PH125.3x), part of the Data Science Professional Certificate. Topics include foundational probability concepts, combinatorics, distributions, sampling models, and the Central Limit Theorem.

## Sections

1. Discrete Probability  
2. Continuous Probability  
3. Random Variables and Sampling Models  
4. Central Limit Theorem  

## Packages Used

- `tidyverse`
- `gtools`

## Files

- `section1_esoph_discrete.R`: Discrete probability analysis using the built-in `esoph` dataset. Includes conditional probabilities for cancer cases and controls by alcohol/tobacco consumption level, AND/OR logic, and relative risk comparison between groups.
- `section2_ACTscores_continuous.R`: Simulation and analysis of ACT test scores using a normal distribution. Includes calculations of mean, standard deviation, tail probabilities, Z-scores, quantiles, and CDF implementation.
- `section3_sat_guessing_simulation.R`: Simulation and analysis of SAT guessing behavior under both old and new scoring systems. Covers expected value, standard error, normal approximation (CLT), Monte Carlo simulation, and success probability thresholds by skill level.
