# 📈 Data Science: Linear Regression – HarvardX (PH125.7x)

This repository contains code and exercises from the HarvardX course *Data Science: Linear Regression* (PH125.7x), part of the Data Science Professional Certificate. The course explores how linear models can be applied to real-world scenarios, particularly using baseball statistics.

## 📁 Files

- `section1_baseball_intro.R`: Visual exploration of baseball team statistics between 1961 and 2001 using scatterplots. Includes analyses of runs vs at-bats, win rate vs errors, and triples vs doubles.
- `section1_baseball_correlation.R`: Computes correlation coefficients between runs and at-bats, win rate and errors, and doubles and triples using per-game statistics.
- `section1_Galton_Families_stratification_variance.R`: Uses the GaltonFamilies dataset to investigate the regression relationship between mothers' and daughters' heights and interprets the proportion of variance explained (R²).



> More sections and files will be added as the course progresses.
