# 📊 Data Science: Visualization – HarvardX (PH125.2x)

This folder contains coursework and exercises from the HarvardX course *Data Science: Visualization* (PH125.2x), focused on data visualization techniques in R using `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and best practices for effective graphical presentation.

## 📁 Files

### Section 1: Introduction to Data Visualization and Distributions
- `section1_murders_distribution.R`: Bar plot and proportion analysis using the `murders` dataset (region, population, murder rates).

### Section 2: Introduction to ggplot2
- `section2_murders_ggplot.R`: Scatter plots and labeled visualizations of murder data using `geom_point()`, `geom_label()`, log scales, and region-based color mapping.
- `section2_heights_ggplot.R`: Histogram and density plots of height data using `geom_histogram()` and `geom_density()` with sex-based grouping and alpha blending.

### Section 3: Summarizing with dplyr
- _[Currently no separate script files listed under this section]_  

### Section 4: Gapminder Data Exploration
- `section3_gapminder.R`: Visualization of economic development and health in African countries using `gapminder`. Includes log-scaled density plots, infant mortality vs. income scatter plots, and year-by-year comparisons (1970 & 2010) with region-based coloring and country labels.

### Section 5: Titanic Data EDA and Visualization
- `section4_titanic_eda.R`: Exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset, including QQ-plots, barplots, boxplots, and density plots of age by survival, faceted by sex and class. Also includes log-transformed fare analysis and jittered plots.
