## 📁 Files

- `section1_murders_distribution.R`: Bar plot and proportion analysis using the `murders` dataset (region, population, murder rates).
- `section2_murders_ggplot.R`: Scatter plots and labeled visualizations of murder data using `geom_point()`, `geom_label()`, log scales, and region-based color mapping.
- `section2_heights_ggplot.R`: Histogram and density plots of height data using `geom_histogram()` and `geom_density()` with sex-based grouping and alpha blending.
- `section3_gapminder.R`: Visualization of economic development and health in African countries using `gapminder`. Includes log-scaled density plots, infant mortality vs. income scatter plots, and year-by-year comparisons (1970 & 2010) with region-based coloring and country labels.
- `section4_titanic_eda.R`: Exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset, including QQ-plots, barplots, boxplots, and density plots of age by survival, faceted by sex and class. Also includes log-transformed fare analysis and jittered plots.
