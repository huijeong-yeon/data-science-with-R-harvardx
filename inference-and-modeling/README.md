## üìÅ Files

- `section1_parameters_estimates.R`: Analytical derivation of expected values and standard errors for binomial sampling. Covers sample totals, proportions, and differences in estimated proportions between groups.
- `section2_central_limit_theorem.R`: Simulation-based exploration of the Central Limit Theorem. Includes histogram of sampling errors and analysis of how sample size affects standard error using visualizations and threshold detection.
- `section3_confidence_interval_for_p.R`: Confidence interval estimation for the proportion of Clinton voters based on 2016 U.S. election polling data. Includes data filtering, proportion calculation, standard error derivation, CI coverage evaluation, and hit rate summary.
- `section3_confidence_interval_for_d.R`: Computes the confidence interval for the difference in support (spread) between Clinton and Trump based on 2016 U.S. national election polls. Includes transformation from spread to proportion, standard error calculation, CI construction, hit rate evaluation, and pollster-wise error visualization (boxplots for all pollsters and those with ‚â•5 polls).
